The application can work in two versions of water data. The first option: the user selects the name of the city of interest to him from the proposed list. The second option is to work with the application: the user independently enters the name of the city in the input field.

Special conditions of the input: the name of the city must be written in English, the name of the city must be spelled correctly, since the city is called in official sources of information.

Thank you for using our application)))
