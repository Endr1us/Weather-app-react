Weather application for viewing the main weather indicators for the current day and for five future days.

The weather application is developed on the javascript library react.

The application is cross-browser, suitable for working on desktop devices, and also suitable for working on mobile devices starting with a screen size of 320 pixels.

The application can work in two versions of water data. The first option: the user selects the name of the city of interest to him from the proposed list. The second option is to work with the application: the user independently enters the name of the city in the input field.

Special conditions of the input: the name of the city must be written in English, the name of the city must be spelled correctly, since the city is called in official sources of information.

Thank you for using our application)))
